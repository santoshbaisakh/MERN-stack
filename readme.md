HTML :

- HTML stands for HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE.
- It is used for structuring the websites.
- Html is a markup language because it contains the skeleton structure of a webpage.
and it is build on tags.
- All the HTML it written with tags.
The main element of HTML is <html> tag.


 Head:           
  - in head tag we have some tags like <title> & some meta elements.
  - <title> tag contains our website title in the title bar.
  - meta elements help us to create responsive with some size.
  - we also attatch some external style sheet link in that head tag.

Body :
  - body contain all the page structure of a webpage.
  we can design & develop all the things in the body part.

Heading:
  - Heading is a major element in our HTML page.
  - there are 6 types of header are there (h1-h6)
  - <h1> is the largest heading & <h6> is the smallest.
Paragraph:
  - Paragraph plays a major role to describe our data or information breifly.
  - it is denoted by a element <p>.
Break:
  - it is used to break the line and create a newline. it is denoted by <br>.
  - it is a single tag.
Horizontal tag:
  - it is used to create a horizontal line.
  - it is also a single tag.
Image tag:
  - to put an image in our website, we need <img> tag to add image.
  - it is a single tag.
  - in img tag, there are some elements to configure image in the right direction.
  - attributes describe the behaviour of an HTML element.
  - atributes in <img> tag are:
     -> src (image source)
     -> alt (alternate of the image, image name can be put)
     -> height (image height)
     -> width (image width)
Anchor tag:
  - it is used to attach external links in our web pages.
  - it is denoted by <a>.
  - anchor tag contains 2 attributes -> href  and target
    -> href (hyper reference) : reference a point or page on another web page.
    -> target : how we can open that link.
          |-> _self : it opens that link in our own website itself.
          |-> _blank : it opens the link  by creating a new tab.
HTML Formatting :
  - to format the text in a proper way.
  - there are 10 types of formatting.
     -> <b> : for BOLD.
     -> <i> : for ITALICS.
     -> <em> : to emphasize the text.
     -> <small> : for small text.
     -> <ins> : for insert text.
     -> <del> : delete text.
     -> <mark> : mark text.
     -> <strong> : stronger text.
     -> <sup> : superscript.
     -> <sub> : subscript




HTMl Table :-

- As we draw a normal table to maintain our data so html provide a table like structure.
- <table> is the main tag of html table.
- inside html table we have
    - <tr> -> table row
    - <td> -> table data
    - <th> -> table heading
ex.


sl. no.     name    salary
1           rakesh  23000
2           rishi   54000
3           sai     67000
4           ritesh  43000

HTML LIST :-

- As our day to day life, when we store some data inside a proper format that we called our list of data.
- HTMl also provide a list to store some data inside it.
- In HTML there are 2 types of list are there....

1. Unordered list ->

- When we store that data in a un-organized form that called our unordered list.
- It is denoted by <ul>
- Inside <ul> tag we have <li> tag. (<li> -> list item )


2. Ordered list -> 

- When we store that data in a organized form that called ordered list.
- It is denoted by <ol>.
- Inside <ol> tag we have <li> tag. (<li> -> list item )

ex.

- My fav. skills are -> (UL)
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JS

- My fav. hobbies are -> (OL)
    1. read newspaper
    2. do coding
    3. practicing 

Block level element & inline element in HTML :-

Block level element -> 

- a block level element always starts on a new line, and the browser automatically add some space before and after the element.
- a block level element always takes up the full width available.

ex. <div>, <p>, <main>, <form>, <section> etc...

Inline Element ->

- An inline element does not starts on a new line.
- An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

ex. <span>, <label>, <button>, <sup>, <sub>, <br> etc.....

Form in HTML :-

- an HTMl form is used to collect some user inputs for the data storage purpose.
- <form> tag is the main tag of HTML Form.
- Inside <form> tag we have label & input tag for take the user input.
- there are some input tags like -->

1. <input type="text">
2. <input type="button">
3. <input type="checkbox">
4. <input type="color">
5. <input type="date">
6. <input type="email">
7. <input type="file">
8. <input type="hidden">
9. <input type="image">
10. <input type="month">
11. <input type="number">
12. <input type="password">
13. <input type="radio">
14. <input type="range">
15. <input type="search">
16. <input type="submit">
17. <input type="time">
18. <input type="url">
19. <input type="week">
20. <input type="tel">

Semantic Tag in HTML :-

- Writing semantic markup means understanding the hierarchy of your content and how both mechanisms will work on a web browser.

- Most common semantic tags are...
    - header
    - main
    - nav
    - section
    - article
    - aside
    - footer etc...

CSS :-

- CSS stands for cascading style sheet.
- Basically it is used for the designing & styling our web pages.
- CSS is not a programming language, it's a styling language...
- Syntax :- 

selector{
    properties: value;
}
ex.

h1{
    color: red 
}

- In the above example h1 is the selector, color is the properties & red is the value of that properties.
- there are 3 types of CSS are present. like..

1. Inline CSS :-

- We used inline css inside the tag name.
- inline css have highest priority by compare with other types of css.
- we can put our styling by creating a "style" attribute inside the tag.
2. Internal CSS:- 

- we used internal css inside <head> tag, by creating a <style> tag inside it.
- internal css used many cases for small codebase.
3. External CSS :- 

- we used external css by creating a separate CSS file and link that file in our HTML page.
- we can link the external css file by <link> tag.
- it is most popularly used because everyone wants to see the clean code so all files have to be separated.


Selectors in CSS :-

- we used css selectors for selecting an HTML element for the shake of designing.
- There are basically 5 types of selectors are there...

1. ID selector :-

- ID selector is a type of selector that used for unique design.
- It is denoted by "#".

2. Class selector :-

- Class selector is a type of selector that used for similar design in multiple element.
- it is denoted by "."

3. Group selector :-

- Group selector is a type of selector that used for design more than one element by creating a group.

4. Universal selector :- 

- Universal selector is a type of selector that used for design whole HTML element in a single design.
- It is denoted by "*".

5. Element selector :- 

- Element selector is a type of selector that used for design single single element separately.

Practice task :-

1. Create a simple div with an id "box". Add some text content inside th div. Set it's background color to "blue".

2. Create 3 headings with h1, h2, and h3. Give them all a class "heading" & set color of heading to "red".

Properties in CSS :-

1. color : red/blue/green etc...
2. background-color : red/green/blue etc...
3. text-align : left/right/center
4. text-decoration : underline/ overline/ line-through
5. font-weight : normal/ bold/ bolder/ 100/ 300/ 900 etc...
6. font-family : italic/ san-serif/ roboto/ cursive
7. line-height : 1/ 2/ 4/ 5 etc....
8. text-transform : uppercase/ lowercase/ capitalize

etc....

Box model in CSS :-

- Box model is used for properly placed the element in the right direction.
- It measures all the size of that particular element and place them.
- There are 5 types of box model are there....

1. Height
2. Width
3. Border (border-radius)
4. Margin (left, right, top, bottom)
5. Padding (left, right, top, bottom)

Display properties in CSS :- 

- we used display property to showcase our element in a proper form to display.
- basically there are 4 types of display property like...

1. display-inline -> takes only the space required by the element.
2. display-block -> takes full space available in width.
3. display-inline-block -> similar to display inline but difference is that when we apply padding over here.
4. display-none -> to remove element from the document flow. (none - nothing)

Flex-Box in CSS :-


- we can use CSS flex-box to create one dimensional design in a single page.
- flex-box have some properties like..

1. display: flex;
2. flex-direction: row/row-reverse/column/column-reverse
3. justify-content: center/ space-between/ space-evenly/ space-around
4. align-item: center/top/bottom
5. flex-wrap: wrap/no-wrap

Grid-Layout in CSS :-

- CSS grid-layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web.
- A grid is a collection of horizontal & vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up our design element.
- some important properties of grid-layout...

1. display: grid;
2. grid-template-columns: repeat(4,1fr)/ 100 200 300;
3. grid-gap: 20px/ 30px etc..
4. grid-auto-rows: 100px / 200px etc...

CSS Units :-

- Basically there are multiple units in CSS but we will discuss some important units.

1. px (pixel) - fixed
2. % (percentage) - percentage fully depends upon their parent element

ex.

rekesh - 100 -> 20% -> 20
bikash - 1000 -> 20% -> 200

3. vh (viewport height) & vw (viewport width) -> it will increase or decrease their size as per the screen size.

4. vmax (viewport maximum) -> if the screen size can be squized to a phone screen so our content can be small so it break that and create a new line of content.

5. em & rem (root units of css) -> we can handle all the tag by a root element/tag so that it would be feasible for our content.

html - semantic tags
css - animation (scale, skew, rotate, etc....)

Position Property in CSS :- 

- The position property specify the type of positioning method used for an element.

- there are 5 types of position property are there...

1. static - default value, it does not change their position.
2. relative - the element is positioned relative to it's normal position.
3. absolute - the element is positioned relative to it's ancestors.
4. fixed - the element is positioned relative to the browser window.
5. sticky - the element is positioned based on the user scroll position.

Animation in CSS :-

Animation (transition) :- To change the state of an object

- transition enables you to define the transition between two states of an element.
- some important transition properties are...

1. transition-property : property you want to transition (font-size, color, bg color)
2. transition-duration : 2s/3s/4s etc...;
3. transition-timing-function : ease-in/ ease-out/ ease-in-out/ linear/ steps(4) etc...
4. transition-delay : 2s/3s/4s/5s etc....;

- transition shorthand (property names/duration/timing-function/delay)
     transition: font-size 2s ease-in 5s;

Animation (transform) :-

- it is used to apply 2D and 3D transformation to an element.

1. Transform (Rotate) ->
    - transform: rotate(45deg/90deg etc...)
    - rotate: 45deg;
    - rotateX: 45deg;
    - rotateY: 45deg;
    - rotateZ: 45deg;

2. Transform (scale) ->

    - transform: scale(2/3 etc...)
    - transform: scale(1,2)
    - transform: scaleX(0.5)
    - transform: scaleY(0.5)

3. Transform (Skew) ->

    - transform: skew(45deg);
    - transform: skewX(45deg);
    - transform: skewY(45deg);
    - transform: skewZ(45deg);

Animation (keyframe) ->

- It is a special CSS rule that define the different stages of an animation over the time.

- syntax :- 

@keyframe spinScale{
    0%{
        transform: rotate(0deg) scale(1);
    }
    50%{
        transform: rotate(180deg) scale(1.5);
    }
    100%{
        transform: rotate(360deg) scale(2);
    }
}

In keyfrmaes the properties are ->

- animation-duration
- animation-timing-function
- animation-delay
- animation-iteration count
- animation-direction

Note -> @keyframe is the heart of css animation 

Rest Topic ->

HTML - Semantic tags
CSS - key-frames animation

JavaScript :-

- JavaScript is used for building logics of a web page.
- javascript is a high-level programming language, used in both client side (frontend) as well as server side (backend).
- JavaScript comes from echma script so we see the latest version of javascript in terms of echma script.
- the latest version of javascript is ES16.
- Node JS is the runtime environmment of javascript.

Variable in JavaScript :-

- Variable is a container to store some digital data inside it.
- In JavaScript there are 3 types of variable are there

1. var :-

- var is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable value in later stage.
- var is used in older browser, so now in these days we will don't use the var most of the cases.

2. let :-

- let is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable value in later stage.
- let is a block scope/function scope so we have been used let most of the cases.

3. const - constant

Rules for creating the variable name :- 

- Variable names are case-sensitive like "a" & "A" is different.
- only letters, digits, underscore & special character($) is allowed.
(Do not keep white space over here)
- only letter, underscore, or special character($) should be the 1st character only.
- reserved words can not be a variable name.
ex. fro, while, var, let, console etc...

Datatype in JavaScript :-
- Datatype is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret it's value.
- In datatype we used "typeof" operator to know, what type of data it is. 
- mainly in JavaScript there are 2 types of datatypes are there..

1. Primitive datatype :-

- In primitive datatype there are 7 types of primitive datatypes are there...

1. Number - Number are the type of datatype those it contain some numerical values.
2. Boolean - In boolean datatype we got boolean value like true/false.
3. Undefined - the data is not defined.
4. Null - Nothing
5. bigInt - Big integer value
6. String - sequence of characters 
7. Symbol - In symbol we got one symbol of more than one value.

2. Reference / non-primitive datatype :-


- Reference datatype are the type of datatype which can hold multiple element in a single frame.
- There are 3 types of reference datatypes are there..

1. Array :-

- Array is a collection of similar type of data stored in contigious memory location. 
- Array index starts from "0".

2. Object :- 

- object is a reference datatype where we can store more than one element in a single frame.
- mainly objects are working on (key: value) pair.

ex.

let hari = {
    "name" : "Hari Babu",
    "Phone-no" : 6765645345,
    "Addresss" : "Bhubaneswar",
    "Career" : "Good"
}

- In the above example left hand side are the "keys" , right hand sides are the "values" of that keys & hari is our object name.

3. Function :- 

- Function is a block of code that perform specific task.
- Function reduce our code complexity, time & space complexity.
- syntax :- 

function creation -> 

function my_schedule(){
    console.log("I wake up at 5 am")
    console.log("Then take a good shower")
    console.log("Eat breakfast with a cup of tea")
}

function calling -> 

my_schedule()
my_schedule()

Operator in JS :-

- operator are key features to do some task.
- ex. A + B
- In the above example A & B are the operandds & "+" sign is our operator.
- In javascript, there are 5 types of operator are there...

1. Arithmetic operator -> (+, -, *, /, %, **)
2. Assignment operator -> (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=)
3. Comparision operator -> (==, !==, ===, <, >, <=, >=)
4. Logical operator -> Logical AND (&&), Logical OR (||), Logical NOT (!)
5. Unary operator -> Increment (++), decrement (--)

Conditional Statement ->

- To implement some condition in the code.
- there are 3 types of conditional statement are there...

1. if Condition :-

- if condition is true then statement is true.
- syntax :-

if(condition){
    statement
}

2. if-else condition :-

- if condition is true then statement is true otherwise false.
- syntax :-

if(condition){
    statement
}else{
    statement
}

3. if-elif condition :-
- it's check the condition multiple times, where the condition is true, it returns the statement.
- syntax :-

if(condition){
    statement
}else if(condition){
    statement
}else if(condition){
    statement
}else{  // default condition
    statement
}

practice task :-

write a code which give grades to student according to their score...

1. 90-100 (A)
2. 80-89 (B)
3. 70-79 (C)
4. 60-69 (D)
5. 50-59 (E)
6. 0-49 (F-Fail)

Loops in JavaScript :-

- Loops are used to execute a piece of code again and again.
- there are 5 types of loops are there...

1. for loop ->

- syntax :-

for(initialization; condition; updation){
    statement
}

ex. we want to print "javascript" 5 times...

for(let i = 1; i <= 5 ; i++){
    console.log("Javascript")
}

working ->

i = 1 -> javascript
i = 2 -> javascript
i = 3 -> javascript
i = 4 -> javascript
i = 5 -> javascript

2. while loop ->

- syntax :- 

initialization;
while(condition){
    statement;
    updation;
}

3. do-while loop ->

- syntax :- 

initialization;
do{
    statement;
    updation;
}while(condition)

4. for-in loop -> it iterates on string & array
5. for-of loop -> it iterates on objects

String in JavaScript :- 

- basically string is a sequence of character used to represent text.
- create a string -> let str = "web bocket".
- we calculate the string length -> str.length property.
- we calculate the string index -> str[0], str[1], str[2] etc...

String literals & interpolation -> 

string literals :-

- It's a way to have embedded expression in string.
- it's denoted by symbol ``.

string interpolation :-

- to create a string by doing substitution of placeholder.
- ex. -> string text $(expression) string text.

escape symbol in string :-

1. \n -> new line 
2. \t -> new tab 

string methods :-

1. str.toUpperCase()
2. str.toLowerCase()
3. str.trim()
4. str.slice(start, (end-1))
5. str1.concat(str2)
6. str.replace(oldVal, newVal)
7. str.replaceAll(oldVal, newVal)
8. str.charAt(idx)

Array in JavaScript :-

- array is a collection of items.
- ex. let arr = ["iron man", "bat man", "spider man"]
- array index starts from "0".
- indexing of array -> arr[0], arr[1], etc...

Looping over an array ->

- Loop -> iteration 
-  syntax -> for (let i = 0; i < arr.length(); i++){
    statement
}

Methods of array :-

1. push() -> add an element to end of an array
2. pop() -> remove from the end of an array
3. toString() -> convert array to string
4. concat() -> add two or more array / join multiple array
5. unshift -> add an element to the start of an array
6. shift() -> remove an element to the start of an array
7. slice() -> return a piece of the array
8. splice() -> change original array (add, remove, replace)

practice question ->

1. For a given array with marks of students -> [78,90,54,32,98,25,70].
find the average mark of the student.

2. For a given array with price of 5 items -> [789,543,590,432,489].
all items have an offer of 10% off of them. change the array to store final price after applying offer.

Function in JavaScript :-

- It is a block of code that perform specific task, can be invoked or called whenever we need.
- ex. (in-build function )

1. console.log("hello") -> in this code .log() is a function
2. "abc".toUpperCase() -> in this code .toUpperCase() is a function 
3. [1,2,3].push(4) -> in this code .push() is a function

- There are two types of function in JavaScript.
1. Normal Function ->

-> Type-A function ->

// Function creation ->

function Function_name(){
    // do some task
}

// Function calling ->

Function_name()

Type-B Function ->

// Function creation ->

function Function_name(parameter_1, parameter_2){
    // do some task
}

// Function calling ->

Function_name(arg_1, arg_2)

2. Arrow Function ->

- It is a compact way of writing a function.
- It uses map() function to retrieve the backend data, filter() function for filterise our data etc...

// Function creation ->

const function_name = (param_1, param_2) => {
    // to do some task
}

// function calling ->

function_name(arg_1, arg_2)

normal function ->
function sum(a,b){
    return a + b;
}
sum(2,3)

arrow function ->

const sum = (a,b) => {
    return a + b;
}
sum(2,3)

Practice Question -> 

1. Create a function using the "function" keyword that takes a string as an argument & return the number of vowels in that string. (TCS)

Map method / function in JS :-

- create a new array with result of some operation. The value it's callback return are used to form a new array. Normally we create a new array by calling the function in every array element.

- Map does not change the original array.
- It does not execute the function for empty array.
- syntax :-

arr.map(callbackFunction(value, index, array))

Filter method / Function in JS :-

- Create a new array of element that gives true for a condition / filterization.
- ex. all even array in the given digits.

let newArr = arr.filter((val) =>{
    return val % 2 == 0;
})

For Each loop in array :-

- arr.forEach(callbackFunction)
- callbackFunction -> it is a function to execute for each element in the array.
- callbackFunction is a function that passed as an argument of another function.

Advance JS :-

1. DOM
2. Event & Event handling
3. Sync & Async code (promise, .then, .catch, async, & await)
4. API handling

DOM in JavaScript :-

- Basically DOM stands for Document Object Model.
- When a web page is loaded, the browser create a document object model of that page.
- The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree like structure

windows -> document -> HTML -> Head -> meta tags & title
                            -> body -> h1, h2, img etc...

Why we used DOM in JavaScript :-

- JavaScript can change all the HTML element in the page.
- JavaScript can create, delete or edit any HTML page directly through DOM.
- JavaScript can also access CSS styling directly.

Window Object :-

- The window object represents an open window in a browser.
- it is a browser object & it automatically created by browser.
- it is also a global object with lots of properties & methods.

DOM Manipulation :-

1. Selecting with ID -> document.getElementById("myID")

2. Selecting with class -> document.getElementsByClassName("myClass")

3. Selecting with Tag -> document.getElementsByTagName("p")

4. Query Selector ->

    - document.querySelector("id/class/tag")
    - document.querySelectorAll("id/class/tag")

5. Attributes ->

    - getAttribute(attr) -> to get the attribute value
    - setAttribute(attr, value) -> to set the attribute value

6. Insert Element ->

    - node.append(ele) -> adds at the end of the node (inside)
    - node.prepend(ele) -> adds at the start of the node (inside)
    - node.after -> adds after the node (outside)
    - node.before -> adds before the node (outside)

7. Delete Element ->

    - node.remove(ele) -> remove the node

Event in JavaScript :-

- The change in the state of an object is known as event.
- Some famous events are...

1. Mouse Events (click, dblClick, onMouseover)
2. Keyboard Event (keypress, keyUp, keyDown)
3. Form Event (submit)
4. Print Event...

Event Handling :-

- Syntax :-

node.event = () => {
    // hnadle here 
}

Event Object :-

- It is a special object that has details about the event.
- All event handler have access to the event objects properties and methods.
- syntax :-

node.event = (e) => {
    // handle here
}

- In methods you can get -> e.target, e.type etc....

practice task :-

Q. create a toggle button that changes the screen to dark mode when clicked and light mode when clicked again

Sync in JavaScript :-

Synchronous :-

- Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instruction given in the program.
- Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete it's execution.

ex. 

console.log("one")
console.log("two")
console.log("Get data")
console.log("three")

Output -> one two three

Asynchronous :-

- Due to synchronous programming, sometimes important instruction get blocked due to some previous instruction, which causes a delay in the UI.
- Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instruction immediately and doesn't block the flow.

ex. 

console.log("one")
console.log("two")
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("three")
},4000) // 4000 ms = 4s
console.log("Four")
console.log("five")

output -> one, two, Four, five, three

Callback in JavaScript :-

- A callback function which passed as an argument of another function.

Callback hell :-

- It's a nested callback stacked below one after another forming a pyramid structure.
- This style of programming becomes difficult to understand & manage.

promise in JS :-

- it is a solution of callback hell.
- syntax :-

let promise = new promise ((resolve,reject)=>{
    //statement
})
Promise in JavaScript :-

- It is a solution of callback hell.
- syntax :-

let promise = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
    // statement
})

- a javascript promise object can be ->>

1. pending -> the result is undefined
2. resolved -> the result is a value (fulfilled)
3. reject -> the result is an error

- promise.then((res)=>{
    //statement
})
- promise.catch((err)=>{
    //statement
})

Async & Await in JS :-

- async function always return a promise.
- syntax :-

async function my_func(){
    // statement
}

note :- await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled.

async(statement 1)
await -> statement 2
await -> statement 3
await -> statement 4
await -> statement 5

API handling / fetch API :-

- the fetch API provides an interface for fetching data.
- it uses Requests & Response object.
- the Fetch() methods is used to fetch a data.
- syntax :-

let demo = fetch(URL)

// JSON -> Javascript object notation

Status code of Node JS :-

- 200 -> OK
- 201 -> created 
- 202 -> accepted
- 300 -> multiple choice
- 302 -> found
- 400 -> bad request
- 402 -> payment required
- 404 -> Not found 
- 406 -> not accept 
- 408 -> request timeout
- 500 -> Internal server error
- 502 -> Bad gateway
- 504 -> gateway timeout

Closure in JavaScript :-

- A closure is the combination of a function and it's lexical environment, allowing the function to access variable from it's outer scope even the outer function has finished execution.

Spread Operator :-

- The spread operator (...) in javascript is used to expand element of an array, objects or iterable into individual elements.

- Simply we can say that spread operator allows you to unpack values from arrays or objects.

Higher Order Function :-

- A function that takes another function as an argument or return a function.

React JS :-

- React JS is a frontend javascript library.
- React was developed by facebook by software engineer jordan walke.
- React is also known as react js or ReactJS.
- Basically react is a tool for building UI (user interface) components.

NPX :-

- npx stands for node package execute.
- purpose -> it is an npm package runner bundled automatically with npm.
- function -> it allows you to run & execute javascript package directly from the npm, without needing to install them permanently.
- Storage -> it download the package to a temporary cache memory, execute the command & clear it up right after.

NPM :- 

- npm stands for node package manager.
- purpose -> it is the default package manager for node js.
- function -> it installs, updates, & deletes javascript packages and dependencies for our project.
- storage -> it saves package permanently either locally inside our project's "node modules" folder or globally on our system.

React js History :-

- latest version of react js is 19.2.7
- initial release to the public was in july 2013.
- React js was 1st used in 2011 for facebook's newsfeed features.
- Initially react gained lots of hate for the mix of JavaScript + HTML but in later stage or now these days 45% of software developer used react js as the core library for software development.
- ".jsx" is the extension of react js.
- jsx stands for 'javascript XML' means javascript + html.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- when you are installing react it will have multiple way to install and setup but there are two common way that we are using react js is...

1. CRA (create-react-app)
2. Vite (fastest way to install react js)

File Structure of a React js folder :-

1. readme.md ->

- we will use readme.md for write some description or outline of our project.

2. package.json ->

- it will keep scripts, versions details & dependency of our project.

3. package-lock.json ->

- it basically store dependency of package.json file.

4. .gitignore ->

- files & folders ignored by git tracking...

5. src (source folder) ->

- it is the main source folder where we can create file & write code in it.

6. Public -> Public is used to take our website logo that show publically and we can store images and video in that public folder by creating separate separate folder.

7. node_modules -> auto manages external dependencies that need for execute the project and we can say it is the god father of react js project.

Reacts Hooks :-

- Hooks allow functions to have access to state & other react features without using classes.
- they provide dirct API to concept like props, state ,context etc...
- basically Hook is a function that let us "hook into" react state and lifecycle feature from functional component.
- there are many types of hooks are there but most used hooks are

1. useState()
2. useEffect()
3. useRef()
4. useMemo()
5. useContext()
6. useReducer()
7. useCallback()


1. useState() Hook in React->
- the react useState() hook allows us to track the state of a functional component.

- state generally refers to data or properties that need to be traacking in an application.

import useState ->
    import{useState} from 'react'

initialize useState ->

- we initialize our state by calling useState in our function component
- useState accepts an initial state & return two value.
    
    1. the current state
    2. a function that updates the state


syntax -> const [state, setState] = useState("initial value")
ex -> const[color, setColor] = useColor("red")


useState() question ->
1. toggle button (on/off)
- create a tooggloe button that toogle between ON /OFF
- expected output :ON ->oFF -ON
2. Create a todo list 
- user can add task
- tasks are displayed in a list
- Each task has a delete button
3. Show/Hide password
- toogle button (Show/hide)
- change input type dynamically

useEffect() Hook in react :-

- useEffect is a react hook that lets us perform side effect in functional component, such as...
    -> fetching data from an API
    -> updating the DOM
    -> setting up timer
    -> adding event listener

- Syntax :-

import {useEffect} from "react";

useEffect(() => {
    //  add side effects here
    return () => {
        //  cleanup code (optional)
    }
}, [dependencies]);

1. Runs on Every Render -> 

- if you don't provide any dependency array, the effect runs after every render.
- Syntax :-

useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component rendered")
})

2. Runs only Once (on Mount)

- pass an empty dependency array[].
- Syntax :- 

useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component Mounted")
},[]);

3. Runs When Dependency Changes :-

- the effects run only when the "count" changes.

Syntax :-

useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component Mounted")
},[dependency])

4. cleanup function in useEffect :-

- useful for removing event listener, clearing timer etc....

Syntax :-

useEffect(() => {
    //  add side effects here
    return () => {
        //  cleanup code (optional)
    }
}, [dependencies]);


Solve these questions using useState() hooks :-

1. Complex Form Handling (Object State)
👉 Build a form with fields:

name
email
password

Update all fields using a single useState object

2. Counter with Upper/Lower Limits

👉 Counter should:
Not go below 0
Not exceed 10

3. Derived State Problem

👉 Create: Input field for number
Display its square

Practice Question On useEffect :-

1. Create a component with a button and input field. Print "Component rendered" in console every time component re-renders.

2. Create 2 states ->
    - count
    - name

    print -> effect triggered

    - Only when either count or name changes.

3. Create 
    - One input (text)
    - One Counter (count)

    - Print "Count effect" only when count changes. Not when typing in input.

4. Create a component where, 
    - first effect runs only once
    - second effect runs on every render.
    - third effect runs only when count changes.

5. Create a login system with a boolean state "isLoggedIn".

    - When user logs in -> print "user Logged In"
    - when user logs out -> do nothing. 

    - condition -> useEffect should runs only when "isLoggedIn" becomes true. 

Hint -> use dependency [isLoggedIn] & condition inside useEffect

useRef() hooks in react :-

- useRef() is a react hook that let you store a value that does not cause re-render when it changes.

How we use it ->

- it stores a value using .current
- it does not re-render the component when updated.
- used for ->
    - accessing dom element
    - storing previous value

Practice Question :-

1. Create a component that -> 
    - has a state count
    - uses useRef to store the previous value of count
    - show both :
        - current count
        - previous count

2. Create a component that -> 
    - tracks how many times the component rendered.
    - use useRef 
    - display render count in UI

3. Create a component that -> 
    - start a timer using setInterval
    - store interval ID using useRef
    - has 2 button :
        - start timer 
        - stop timer

4. Create a component that -> 
    - display a div
    - show it's width on screen 
    - uses useRef() to access DOM

use -> ref.current.offSetWidth

5. Create a component that -> 
    - display "first render" on first load.
    - display "updated" on subsequent renders

use -> use boolean ref like : isFirstRender

useMemo() hooks in React JS :-

- useMemo() is a react hook that optimizes preformance by catching (memoization) a value so it doesn't get recalculated on every render.
- In simple words we can say - only recalculated when needed, otherwise reuse the old value.
- syntax :-

const memoization = useMemo(() => {
    //  expensive calculation
    return result;
},[dependency]);

- It runs the function when dependency changes.
- Otherwise, it returns the catched value (memoized value / storage value)

Why we use useMemo() :-

- It prevent unnecessary calculation.
- Improve preformance
- useful for heavy computation / calculation

practice Question of useMemo -> 

1. Remove duplicate from list (using useMemo)
    - create an array with duplicate values. 
    - arr = [1,2,2,3,4,4,5]
    - use useMemo to return a unique list
    - add an input field 

2. Calculate total price 
    - create a list of product 
    - cart = [
        {
            name: 'Shirt', 
            price: 500
        }, 
        {
            name: 'Shoose', 
            price: 1500
        }, 
        {
            name: 'Cap', 
            price: 300
        }, 
    ]
    - calculate total price using useMemo() 
    - add a text input

3. Count Even Numbers 
    - create a large array of numbers (ex. 1 to 10,000)
    - count how many numbers are even
    - use useMemo for counting 
    - add another state (like toggle button)

useCallback() hooks in React JS :-

- useCallback() is a react hook that remember a function so it doesn't get re-created on every render.

Why we use it :-

- In react, every time a component re-render & function are created again.
- This can cause unncessary re-render in child component.
- So useCallback helps to prevent that problem.

- syntax :-

const memoizedFunction = useCallback(() => {
    //  function logic
},[dependencies]);

useContext hooks in React :-

Practice Question on useContext() :-

1. Language Switcher ->
    - Create a context for language (English, Hindi, etc...)
        - add a button to switch language.
        - change displayed text based on selected language.

2. Shopping Cart Count ->
    - Create a CartContext to store cart items count
        - add "add to cart" button
        - displayed total item in nav-bar

3. Nested Component without Props ->
    - Create 3 components: APP -> Parent -> Child
        - Pass data using useContext instead of props
        - display data in child
        - Avoid prop drilling

useReducer() hooks in React JS :-

- useReducer() is a react hook used to manage complex state logics.
- we can say it is the powerful version of useState.
- best to use, When ->
    - State has multiple values.
    - logic is complex.
    - Many action changes the state.

- Syntax :-

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

- where, state -> current value
        dispatch -> function to send action
        reducer -> function that updates the state

1. Counter with Multiple Actions
Create a counter using useReducer with actions:
Increment
Decrement
Reset
👉 Goal: Understand basic reducer logic

2. Todo List with Reducer
Build a Todo app using useReducer:
Add task
Delete task
Mark as completed
👉 Goal: Manage array state with actions

3. Form State Management
Create a form with fields: name, email, password
Update each field using reducer
Reset form on submit
👉 Goal: Handle multiple inputs in one state

4. Shopping Cart System
Create a cart using useReducer:
Add item
Remove item
Increase / decrease quantity
👉 Goal: Real-world state management

5. Toggle Theme (Light/Dark)
Use useReducer to switch themes
Toggle between light & dark mode
👉 Goal: Simple global-like state logic

Virtual DOM in React JS :-

- Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
- like we can say ->
    - real DOM -> Actual House
    - Virtual DOM -> a blueprint (copy of the house)

Process of the virtual DOM :-

- Instead of changing the real DOM every time, react uses virtual DOM for 
    - updating the virtual dom
    - compares it with the previous version
    - changes only the necessary parts in real dom.

Why virtual DOM is useful ?

- faster update
- efficient rendering
- avoid unnecessary full page reload
- improve performance

React Router DOM in React JS :-

- React router dom is a library used in react to handle navigation between pages without reloading the whole website.
- take a example ->
    - /home
    - /about
    - /contact

- react router lets you switch between these pages without refreshing the page.

Axios in React JS :-

- Axios is a popular javascript library used to make HTTP request (API call) from the browser.
    - it helps you fetch data from API's
    - works with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
    - Return data in a clean json format
    - mainly easier than fetch()

Tailwind css:-

- tailwind css basically a utility first css framework.
- rapidly built modern website without ever laeving our HTML.
- with utility classes, we can style element different layout basis.
- it is highly customizable.low level css framework.
- this css framework packed with classes like flex,pt-4 etc...

npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer:- installing tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init -p
